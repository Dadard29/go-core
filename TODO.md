# TODO

- see for SSL integration in CI (need to adapt `go-api-utils`)
- when subscribed, give a token access for the API **DONE**
- make the privileged session for API for creation operations **IN_PROGRESS**
- make a package to check if the requested api is subscribed
- use a .env file for CI (see docker build docs)
