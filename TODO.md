# TODO

- **DONE** - see for SSL integration in CI (need to adapt `go-api-utils`)
- **DONE** - when subscribed, give a token access for the API
- **DONE** - make a package to check if the requested api is subscribed
- **DONE** - reset request count

- **IN_PROGRESS** - remove profile CREATE, UPDATE and DELETE operations from dadard.fr, add those in `echo-slam` controller

- **CANCELLED** - log the request to slave API (beyond just counting, log the time of the request) (useless)
- **CANCELLED** - make the privileged session for API for creation operations
- **CANCELLED** - use a .env file for CI (see docker build docs)
